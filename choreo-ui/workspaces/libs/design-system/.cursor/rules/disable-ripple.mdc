# Disable Ripple Effect in Components

All interactive components in the design system should have ripple effects disabled by default. This includes:

- Buttons
- Radio buttons
- Checkboxes
- Menu items
- List items
- Any other components with Material-UI's ripple effect

## Implementation

When creating or modifying components:

1. Always set `disableRipple={true}` by default
2. For MUI-based components, pass this prop in the base implementation:
```tsx
export const MyComponent = () => (
  <MuiComponent disableRipple {...props} />
);
```

3. For styled components, ensure the ripple is disabled in the base component:
```tsx
const StyledComponent = styled(MuiComponent)`
  /* styles */
`;

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <StyledComponent disableRipple {...props} />
);
```

## Example Implementation
See [Button.tsx](mdc:workspaces/choreo-design-system/src/components/Button/Button.tsx) for a reference implementation of a component with disabled ripple effect.

## Rationale
- Provides a cleaner, more subtle interaction style
- Reduces visual noise
- Maintains consistent behavior across the design system
- Better aligns with modern UI practices
