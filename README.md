## What is OpenChoreo?

OpenChoreo is an open-source internal developer platform (IDP) designed for both platform engineers and developers.
- For platform engineers, Choreo offers a customizable yet fully-featured platform that integrates CI/CD, security, and cloud tools, enforcing best practices while reducing operational overhead.
- For developers, it abstracts away infrastructure complexities, enabling them to focus on building and deploying applications with minimal friction.

Most organizations face a dilemma when adopting an IDP:
1. Build their own by integrating multiple tools—offering control but requiring significant engineering effort and maintenance.
2. Buy a SaaS-based IDP, which simplifies adoption but often limits customization and flexibility.

OpenChoreo provides a third path—a self-hosted, open-source IDP that delivers production-grade capabilities out of the box without sacrificing control or flexibility.

## Inspired by WSO2 Choreo SaaS

OpenChoreo is inspired by **[WSO2 Choreo SaaS](https://choreo.dev/)**, an enterprise-grade internal developer platform that has been adopted by organizations to streamline software delivery and engineering.

WSO2 Choreo SaaS provides a complete IDP experience, combining:

- Software Delivery – Seamless workflows to build, deploy, run, and manage applications at scale.
- Software Engineering – Advanced capabilities for API management, modularity, service reuse, and observability.

With OpenChoreo, we are bringing these capabilities to the open-source community—allowing organizations to run, extend, and customize an internal developer platform on their own infrastructure, while [WSO2 Choreo SaaS](https://choreo.dev/) remains a fully managed alternative.
