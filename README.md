## Introduction

The Choreo repository is a collection of Kubernetes CRDs that enables application development functionalities. These CRDs enable cloud-native deployments, seamless API management, and integration workflows by defining declarative configurations for Kubernetes.

### Choreo Abstractions

This repository defines Choreo abstractions in the form of Kubernetes CRDs, enabling developers to use these abstractions to create projects, components, builds, deployments, and more. By leveraging these CRDs, developers can declaratively manage their application's lifecycle and infrastructure, ensuring consistency and repeatability across environments.

- **DataPlane**: Represents a Data Plane in Choreo, responsible for maintaining the health status of the data plane and providing data plane information to other resources.
- **Environment**: Represents an environment bound to a specific data plane in Choreo, with a reference to an existing `DataPlane` resource.
- **DeploymentPipeline**: Represents an ordered set of environments that a deployment will go through to reach a critical environment, with a default deployment pipeline for each organization.
- **Project**: Represents a project in Choreo, enforcing a promotion order for the components within the project, with an optional reference to a deployment pipeline.
- **Component**: Represents a deployable unit in Choreo, managing the entire lifecycle of the component from source to deployment, with various deployment architectures.
- **DeploymentTrack**: Represents a deployment path for a component, managing the deployment of the component across environments and handling auto deployment and build management.
- **Build**: Represents a source code to artifact transformation, managed by the deployment track controller, responsible for configuring build parameters and tracking build artifacts.
- **DeployableArtifact**: Represents a build artifact with environment-independent configurations, ready to be deployed to an environment, created by the build controller or manually by the user.
- **Deployment**: Represents a deployment in an environment bound to a deployment track, managing deployment revisions, deploying artifacts, and monitoring deployment status.
- **DeploymentRevision**: Represents a snapshot of the deployment resource at a given time, created by the deployment controller to track deployment history and restore deployment specs during revert operations.
- **Endpoint**: Represents an endpoint exposed by the component, responsible for updating Kubernetes resources, creating managed APIs, and configuring API settings.
- **Secret**: Represents configuration parameters stored in a key vault, used for storing both system secrets and environment-specific secrets, with various secret types like GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, and DockerHub.

These abstractions simplify the development and deployment process, allowing developers to focus on writing code while Choreo handles the underlying infrastructure and operational tasks.

For more details about the abstractions, refer to [Choreo Resource Kinds](docs/README.md).

## Quick Start Guide
This guide will help users set up the necessary prerequisites, download and install the Choreo Helm chart, verify their setup and deploy the sample application.
### _Prerequisites_
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) version v3.15+
- [Cilium](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/k8s-install-default/#install-cilium) installed kubernetes cluster
    - Cilium version v1.15.10
    - kubernetes version v1.22.0+

### Install Choreo using Helm Chart
You can directly install Choreo using the Helm chart provided in our registry.

```shell
helm install choreo-dp oci://choreov3testacr.azurecr.io/choreo-v3/choreo-opensource-dp \
--version 0.1.0 --namespace "choreo-system" --create-namespace --timeout 30m
```

### Install from Scratch Using Kind Cluster

This section guides you through setting up a Kind cluster and installing Cilium and Choreo from the scratch.

#### 1. Install Kind

Make sure you have installed kind : https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation

To verify the installation
    
```shell
kind version
```

#### 2. Create a Kind cluster

```shell
kind create cluster --config=install/kind/kind-config.yaml
```

#### 3. Install Cilium

The following helm chart provided by us installs Cilium with minimal configurations required for Choreo.

```shell
helm install cilium-cni oci://choreov3testacr.azurecr.io/choreo-v3/cilium-cni  --version 0.1.0 --namespace "choreo-system" --create-namespace --timeout 30m
```

#### 4. Install Choreo Helm Chart

```shell
helm install choreo-dp oci://choreov3testacr.azurecr.io/choreo-v3/choreo-opensource-dp  --version 0.2.0 --namespace "choreo-system" --create-namespace --timeout 30m
```

#### 5. Verify installation status

```shell
sh install/check-status.sh
```

### Deploy your first component in choreo

This section guides you through deploying a sample WebApp and invoking it. Go through the following steps to deploy the 
sample WebApp component in Choreo. 

#### 1. Create the sample WebApp component

For this, you will be using the samples we provided in the repository. 
Apply the sample WebApp component using the following command.

```shell
kubectl apply -k config/samples/sample-scheduled-task.yaml
```

> Note: This may take some time to get the source code, build and deploy it

#### 2. Check Created Resources

You can see the resources created by the sample using the following command.
    
```shell
kubectl get orgs,projects,components,dataplanes,deploymentpipelines,deploymenttracks,environments,deployments.core.choreo.dev -A 
```

#### 3. Test the deployed WebApp

You can test the deployed WebApp by port-forwarding the service to your host machine. Refer the following steps to do so.

Use the following command to find the service name for the external gateway.

```shell
kubectl get svc -n choreo-system | grep gateway-external
```

Then port-forward the service to your host machine using the following command.

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/<name> -n choreo-system 443:443
```

Then add the following entry to your /etc/hosts file.

```
127.0.0.1 webapp1-dev.choreo.local
```

Now you can access the WebApp using the following URL.

https://webapp1-dev.choreo.local

## Contributor Guide

This section provides a comprehensive guide for contributors to set up their development environment, build and use the binaries, and deploy Choreo on a Kubernetes cluster for testing and development purposes.

### Prerequisites for Contributors
- Go version v1.23.0+
- Docker version 17.03+
- Kubernetes cluster with version v1.30.0+

### Build and Use Binaries

1. Clone the repository:
                ```sh
                git clone https://github.com/<org>/choreo.git
                cd choreo
                ```

2. Build the binaries:
                ```sh
                make build
                ```

3. Run the binaries:
                ```sh
                ./bin/manager
                ```

4. Follow the deployment steps mentioned below under "To Deploy on the cluster" section.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/choreo:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don’t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/choreo:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

### Code Generation and Linting

After updating the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) or the controller code, run the following commands to generate necessary code and lint the codebase before committing the changes.

1. Run the linter:
    ```sh
    make lint
    ```
2. Run the code generator:
    ```sh
    make code.gen
    ```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/choreo:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/choreo/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```
### Implement Custom Resources
**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
