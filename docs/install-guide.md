# OpenChoreo Installation

This guide walks you through installing and setting up OpenChoreo on a single Kubernetes cluster using kind. 
The *Control Plane* and *Data Plane* components will run on the same cluster. This is ideal for local development or trying out OpenChoreo quickly.

You'll start by creating a compatible Kubernetes cluster with Cilium as the CNI. Then, install OpenChoreo using the Control Plane (CP) and Data Plane (DP) Helm charts, and configure the `choreoctl` CLI tool..

Additionally, the guide provides options to expose the OpenChoreo external gateway service to your host machine, enabling seamless access to the components deploy in OpenChoreo.

### Kind

In this section, you'll learn how to set up a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster and install Cilium into that for making it compatible with OpenChoreo.

#### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have installed [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation), version v0.27.0+.
   To verify the installation:
    ```shell
    kind version
    ```

2. Make sure you have installed [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), version v3.15+.
   To verify the installation:

    ```shell
    helm version
    ```
3. Make sure you have installed [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl), version v1.32.0.
   To verify the installation:

    ```shell
    kubectl version --client
    ```

#### Create a Kind Cluster

Run the following command to create your kind cluster using ([kind config](../install/kind/kind-config.yaml)).

```shell
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openchoreo/openchoreo/main/install/kind/kind-config.yaml | kind create cluster --config=-
```

#### Install Cilium

Cilium must be installed on the Data Plane cluster to work with OpenChoreo. To do so, use the Helm chart provided with the minimal Cilium configuration.

Run the following command to install Cilium:
```shell
helm install cilium oci://ghcr.io/openchoreo/helm-charts/cilium --namespace "choreo-system" --create-namespace --timeout 30m
```

## Install OpenChoreo

OpenChoreo can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster using the official Helm charts provided by the project.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that Cilium is installed in the cluster before proceeding with the Helm chart installation below.

OpenChoreo can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster using the official Helm charts provided by the project.

1. Install OpenChoreo using Helm

Run the following two Helm commands to install OpenChoreo into your cluster:

```shell
helm install choreo-control-plane oci://ghcr.io/openchoreo/helm-charts/choreo-control-plane \
--kube-context kind-choreo --namespace "choreo-system" --create-namespace --timeout 30m --version 0.0.0-latest-dev
```

```shell
helm install choreo-dataplane oci://ghcr.io/openchoreo/helm-charts/choreo-dataplane \
--kube-context kind-choreo  --namespace "choreo-system" --create-namespace --timeout 30m \
--set certmanager.enabled=false --set certmanager.crds.enabled=false --version 0.0.0-latest-dev
```

2. Verify the Installation

Once OpenChoreo is installed, you can verify the installation status using the provided script ([script](../install/check-status.sh)).

Run the verification script:

```shell
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openchoreo/openchoreo/main/install/check-status.sh)
```

> [!TIP]
> Refer to "Exposing the OpenChoreo Gateway" section to learn how to access the components you create in OpenChoreo via the external gateway.

## Add Default DataPlane

OpenChoreo requires a DataPlane to deploy and manage its resources. You can add the default DataPlane by running the script provided in the repository ([script](../install/add-default-dataplane.sh)).

Run the following command:

```shell
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openchoreo/openchoreo/main/install/add-default-dataplane.sh)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using a cluster that was not created with Kind, you'll need to manually gather the API server
> credentials and create the DataPlane kind yourself.

Once you are done with the installation, you can try out our [samples](../samples) to get a better understanding of OpenChoreo.

## Install the choreoctl

[//]: # (TODO: Refine this once we properly release the CLI as a binary.)

`choreoctl` is the command-line interface for OpenChoreo. With that, you can seamlessly interact with OpenChoreo and manage your resources.

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have installed [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install), version 1.23.5.
2. Make sure to clone the repository into your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/openchoreo/openchoreo.git
   ```

### Step 1 - Build `choreoctl`
From the root level of the repo, run:

```shell
make go.build
```

Once this is completed, it will have a `dist` directory created in the project root directory.

### Step 2 - Install `choreoctl` into your host machine

Run the following command to install the `choreoctl` CLI into your host machine.

```shell
./install/choreoctl-install.sh
````

To verify the installation, run:

```shell
choreoctl
```

You should see the following output:

```text
Welcome to Choreo CLI, the command-line interface for Open Source Internal Developer Platform

Usage:
  choreoctl [command]

Available Commands:
  apply       Apply Choreo resource configurations
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  config      Manage Choreo configuration contexts
  create      Create Choreo resources
  get         Get Choreo resources
  help        Help about any command
  logs        Get Choreo resource logs

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for choreoctl

Use "choreoctl [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Now `choreoctl` is all setup.

### Uninstall choreoctl

If you want to uninstall `choreoctl` from your host machine, you can use the [script](../install/choreoctl-uninstall.sh) that we have provided.

Run the following command to uninstall `choreoctl`:

```shell
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openchoreo/openchoreo/refs/heads/main/install/choreoctl-uninstall.sh | bash
```

## Expose the OpenChoreo Gateway

To enable end-to-end access to the OpenChoreo components you deploy, you need to expose the external gateway service of the Data Plane cluster to your host machine. This allows you to interact with your deployed services seamlessly from outside the cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> To expose deployments within this cluster, we route traffic through the external gateway service which is in the DatPlane.

### Kind

In this section, we will guide you on how to expose the OpenChoreo external gateway service to your host machine in a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster.

Once you successfully [installed OpenChoreo](#install-openchoreo) into your cluster, you will see a LoadBalancer service created for our external gateway.

You can see the service using the following command.

```shell
kubectl --context=kind-choreo get svc choreo-external-gateway -n choreo-system
```

You will see an output similar to the following:

```text
NAME                      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)         AGE
choreo--external-gateway   LoadBalancer   10.96.75.106   <pending>     443:30807/TCP   55m
```

You have two options to expose the DataPlane choreo-external-gateway service to your host machine.

1. Option 1: Use [cloud-provider-kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-kind/tree/main) to expose the service.
2. Option 2: port-forward from your host machine to choreo-external-gateway service.

##### Option 1: Use cloud-provider-kind to expose the service.

The following steps will guide you through using the [cloud-provider-kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-kind/tree/main) tool for exposing the external-gateway service.

First, [install](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-kind/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#install) the cloud-provider-kind tool to your host machine.

Then, run this tool in sudo mode, and it will automatically assign LoadBalancer IP to your choreo-external-gateway service.

```shell
# run this command in a separate terminal and keep it running.
sudo $(which cloud-provider-kind)
```

Then you could find the load balancer IP for your external-gateway service as follows.

```shell
kubectl --context=kind-choreo get svc -n choreo-system | grep choreo-external-gateway
```

```shell
# to find the LoadBalancer-IP
# <name> should be replaced with the service name found in the previous step.
$ kubectl --context=kind-choreo get svc/<name> -n choreo-system -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
```

Then you can use this IP address to access the components you create in OpenChoreo via the external gateway.

##### Option 2: Port-forward the external-gateway service

Run the following command to do port-forwarding from your host machine to the `choreo-external-gateway` service.

```shell
kubectl --context=kind-choreo port-forward svc/choreo-external-gateway -n choreo-system 443:443
```

> [!TIP]
> If you have an existing service listening on port 443, or any permission issues, you may encounter issues when attempting port forwarding. To avoid conflicts, consider changing the port as needed.
> Ex: `kubectl port-forward svc/choreo-external-gateway -n choreo-system 8443:443`

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to add entries to `/etc/hosts` to access components through the external gateway, as it relies on the hostname for request routing.
> For example, if your endpoint URL is `https://default-org-default-project-hello-world-ea384b50-development.choreo.localhost`, and your load balancer IP is `172.19.0.4` you need to add the following entry to your /etc/hosts file.
> `172.19.0.4 default-org-default-project-hello-world-ea384b50-development.choreoapps.localhost`

## Optional: Observe logs in the OpenChoreo setup

Once you have setup OpenChoreo, you could use the observability logs feature in OpenChoreo to explore the setup. 

You can follow the [Observability Logs guide](observability-logging.md) for this purpose.
